# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I delved into several key concepts:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Learned how to dynamically manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and connect it to HTML elements using dataset attributes and classes.
- **Event Listeners:** Utilized mouseenter, mouseleave, and click event listeners to enable drawing functionality.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Revised the use of CSS Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts.
