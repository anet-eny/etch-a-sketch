# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Task Description

The task was to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The application should allow users to draw and paint on a grid of squares.

## Features

- **Drawing Grid:** Create a grid of squares to draw and paint on.
- **Color Selection:** Choose from a variety of colors to draw with.
- **Simplified User Interface:** Intuitive controls using mouse interaction for drawing.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I delved into several key concepts:

- **Null and Empty Variables:** Gained a deeper understanding of null and empty variables and their impact on JavaScript code.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Learned how to dynamically manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and connect it to HTML elements using dataset attributes and classes.
- **Event Listeners:** Utilized mouseenter, mouseleave, and click event listeners to enable drawing functionality and color selection.
- **Code Simplification:** Used variables, like selectedColor, to simplify code and improve readability.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Revised the use of CSS Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts.

## Usage

To use the Etch-A-Sketch application, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Click me" button to create a grid of squares.
3. Move your mouse over the squares to draw.
4. Click on the color buttons to select a drawing color.
5. Click on the squares to erase or change the color of your drawings.

## How to Run

You can run the Etch-A-Sketch application directly in your web browser by opening the `index.html` file. No additional installations or setups are required.
